Thanks for using TSSSaver! In this release:

The app is now OPEN SOURCE! Check the source out at https://github.com/nullpixel/tsssaver.
Fixed some crahses on some devices, send me logs if you have em!
Added a sexy icon! Thanks ProjectB.
Added this fancy-spinner-thing so you know it's actually doing stuff.
Should be much more stable.

Sideload support will be in the next version!
